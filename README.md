# Car Price Prediction Using Linear and Lasso Regression

This project predicts car selling prices using two types of regression models: **Linear Regression** and **Lasso Regression**. The dataset used contains car details, including features like fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and more. The models are evaluated using **R-squared** scores, and visualization is done using scatter plots.

## Project Overview

This project involves the following steps:
1. Data loading and preprocessing.
2. Data exploration and visualization.
3. Encoding categorical variables.
4. Building two regression models:
   - **Linear Regression**
   - **Lasso Regression**
5. Training the models and making predictions.
6. Evaluating the models using R-squared scores.
7. Visualizing the results using scatter plots.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about used cars, such as:
- Car name
- Selling price
- Present price
- Number of kilometers driven
- Fuel type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
- Seller type (Dealer/Individual)
- Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)
- Car age

The dataset is stored in the file `car data.csv`.
